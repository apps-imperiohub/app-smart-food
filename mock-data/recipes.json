    "strInstructions": "Squeeze lime over chicken and rub well. Drain off excess lime juice. Combine tomato, scallion, onion, garlic, pepper, thyme, pimento and soy sauce in a large bowl with the chicken pieces. Cover and marinate at least one hour. Heat oil in a dutch pot or large saucepan. Shake off the seasonings as you remove each piece of chicken from the marinade. Reserve the marinade for sauce. Lightly brown the chicken a few pieces at a time in very hot oil. Place browned chicken pieces on a plate to rest while you brown the remaining pieces. Drain off excess oil and return the chicken to the pan. Pour the marinade over the chicken and add the carrots. Stir and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Then add enough water to fully cover the chicken. Cover the pot and simmer until the meat is tender and fully cooked. This should take about 30 minutes. Combine flour and curry powder with about 1/4 cup water. Mix well. Pour into the stewing chicken and stir well to blend. Continue cooking for about 5 more minutes and turn off stove. Enjoy your Brown Stew Chicken with a side of white rice or Jamaican rice and peas.",

Add the honey and season to taste. Simmer for 20 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To assemble the lasagne, ladle a little of the ragu sauce into the bottom of the roasting tin or casserole dish, spreading the sauce all over the base. Place 2 sheets of lasagne on top of the sauce overlapping to make it fit, then repeat with more sauce and another layer of pasta. Repeat with a further 2 layers of sauce and pasta, finishing with a layer of pasta. To make the white sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the plain flour and cook for 2 mins. Slowly whisk in the milk, then bring to the boil, stirring. Turn down the heat and simmer for a few mins, whisking all the time, until thickened and smooth. Season to taste, then stir in half the Parmesan. Pour the white sauce over the pasta, making sure the whole surface is covered, right to the edges of the dish. Scatter over the remaining Parmesan and cherry tomatoes. Bake for 25-30 mins until golden and bubbling. Serve scattered with basil, if you like.",

Do this at the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface and sprinkle with the flaked almonds. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown and set. Leave to cool for 15 minutes before removing the sides of the tin.

    "strInstructions": "In a wok add chicken broth and wait for it to boil. Next add salt, sugar, white pepper, sesame seed oil. When the chicken broth is boiling add the vegetables to the wok. To thicken the sauce, whisk together 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch and 2 Tablespoon of water in a bowl and slowly add to your soup until it's the right thickness. Next, slowly pour in the beaten eggs constantly stirring so they become more of a ribbon texture in the soup. Serve immediately.",
